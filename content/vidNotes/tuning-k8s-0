I once heard a data scientist said in an interview "everyday i get a bit closer to googling what kubernetes is." I think many data scientists would agree with that sentiment. Everyone can feel that kubernetes is becoming more important, but are unclear how it actually relates to data science. Furthermore, the few DS folks who do mange to type kubernetes into google are often bombarded with a slew of articles bolstering how great kubernetes is, but provides little information on what kubernetes does, or how it can help with DS workloads

In this video series, I'm going to take a well understood ML problem, parameter tuning, and build a pipeline backed by kubernetes to run the training. If you ever wonder how to run parameter tuning on 500 cpu cores, this video will show you how to do that. My hope is that by showing you what kubernetes can do, instead of merely telling you, it'd help you understand what kubernetes is, and how it may be applied to your own day to day work.

The video will utilize Google Cloud Kubernetes service, call GKE. As of the time of this video, Feb, 2020, you can sign up for Google Cloud and get a $300 credit. Making this video I've spend about $10 out of the $300 credit.
