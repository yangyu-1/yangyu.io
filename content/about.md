Hi. My name is Yang. I'm an Analyst working at an east coast E-commerce company, mainly in the marketing department. Most of my work focus on ML, programming, and DevOps. I run a YT channel, [MLOps](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC18byX5bLRU8zdADDzgJh8A), where I try to share some of the knowledge I learn through work. 

I spend my childhood in China and came to the US when I was about 12. Incidentally, I don't speak Chinese or English that well. I went to high school in a small town in New Mexico, college in southeastern US, went back to the southwest for a few years, and now resides in Pennsylvania; when people ask me where I come from, I only end up giving bad directions.

I did Economics in college; it's a fascinating field, hopefully someday I can return to it. 

I learned a lot over the years with free resources on the Internet. Hopefully with this website and the YT channel I can pay it forward. I'd love to hear from you if you find it helpful. I can be reach at yang at yangyu.io.

DevOps, especially Kubernetes, and ML both receive a lot of criticism online; some are nonsense, some are accurate. I guess any new and emerging field will have its fair share of excitement, opportunists, and charlatans. Hopefully you will find this website a bit more pragmatic, a little less hyped.

Side note: I'm still learning how to make educational videos on YT. It is definitely harder than I expected. if you have any tips and tricks you can share on recording/editing/what mic should get for better sound quality, I would love to hear from you.
